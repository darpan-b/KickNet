## Team BSB
**Members**: Darpan Bhattacharya, Ronak Sarkar, and Soham Bhattacharya

**Programme**: M.Sc. in Big Data Analytics 

**Date**: *January 5, 2026* 

## Project Overview
This project is divided into two primary components:
- **Algorithm benchmarking**: A comparative study of DQN, A2C, and PPO on the Atari 2600 Pong environment to evaluate sample efficiency and stability.
- **KickNet**: The development and evaluation of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for a 3v3 soccer environment using shared policies, Independent Actor-Critic (IAC), and MAPPO.

## License
This project was developed for an academic assessment on Deep Reinforcement Learning. Code is based on ```stable-baselines3``` documentation.
